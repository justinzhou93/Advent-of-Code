# Advent-of-Code

These are the problems related to the coding challenge, known as the "Advent of Code".
Each file will represent a different day, with "DayX" being the first part of the problem given on Day X. 
"DayXBonus" will represent the second part of the problem given on each day.

This exercise was completed far after the publication of the site, but all problems should still remain valid on the web.
